<H2 ALIGN="center">ACT I</H2>
<br>
<H3 ALIGN="center">SCENE I</H3>
<br>
<p class="noindent"><I>Night, in the garden of NAAMAN at Damascus.  At the
left, on a
slightly raised terrace, the palace, with softly gleaming lights
and
music coming from the open latticed windows.  The garden is full
of
oleanders, roses, pomegranates, abundance of crimson flowers; the
air
is heavy with their fragrance: a fountain at the right is plashing
gently: behind it is an arbour covered with vines.  Near the centre
of
the garden stands a small, hideous image of the god Rimmon.  Back
of
the arbour rises the lofty square tower of the House of Rimmon,
which
casts a shadow from the moon across the garden.  The background is
a
wide, hilly landscape, with a high road passing over the mountains
toward the snow-clad summits of Mount Hermon in the distance.  Enter
by
the palace door, the lady TSARPI, robed in red and gold, and
followed
by her maids, KHAMMA and NUBTA.  She remains on the terrace: they
go
down into the garden, looking about, and returning to her.</I></p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">KHAMMA:</p>
<p>There's no one here; the garden is asleep.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">NUBTA:</p>
<p>The flowers are nodding, all the birds abed,</p>
<p>And nothing wakes except the watchful stars!</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">KHAMMA:</p>
<p>The stars are sentinels discreet and mute:</p>
<p>How many things they know and never tell!</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">TSARPI: [<I>Impatiently.</I>]</p>
<p>Unlike the stars, how many things you tell</p>
<p>And do not know!  When comes your master home?</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">NUBTA:</p>
<p>Lady, his armour-bearer brought us word</p>
<p>An hour ago, the master will be here</p>
<p>At moonset, not before.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">TSARPI:</p>
<p class="ind4">He haunts the camp</p>
<p>And leaves me much alone; yet I can pass</p>
<p>The time of absence not unhappily,</p>
<p>If I but know the time of his return.</p>
<p>An hour of moonlight yet!  Khamma, my mirror!</p>
<p>These curls are ill arranged, this veil too low,--</p>
<p>So,--that is better, careless maids!  Withdraw,--</p>
<p>But warn me if your master should appear.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">KHAMMA:</p>
<p>Mistress, have no concern; for when we hear</p>
<p>The clatter of his horse along the street,</p>
<p>We'll run this way and lead your dancers down</p>
<p>With song and laughter,--you shall know in time.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">[<I>Exeunt KHAMMA and NUBTA, laughing.  TSARPI descends
the steps.</I>]</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">TSARPI:</p>
<p>My guest is late; but he will surely come!</p>
<p>Hunger and thirst will bring him to my feet.</p>
<p>The man who burns to drain the cup of love,--</p>
<p>The priest whose greed of glory never fails,--</p>
<p>Both, both have need of me, and he will come.</p>
<p>And I,--what do I need?  Why everything</p>
<p>That helps my beauty to a higher throne;</p>
<p>All that a priest can promise, all a man</p>
<p>Can give, and all a god bestow, I need:</p>
<p>This may a woman win, and this will I.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">[<I>Enter REZON quietly from the shadow of the trees.
He stands behind
TSARPI and listens, smiling, to her last words.  Then he drops his
mantle of leopard-skin, and lifts his high-priest's rod of bronze,
shaped at one end like a star, at the other like a thunderbolt.</I>]</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">REZON:</p>
<p>Tsarpi!</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">TSARPI:</p>
<p class="ind2">The mistress of the house of Naaman</p>
<p>Salutes the keeper of the House of Rimmon.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">[<I>She bows low before him.</I>]</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">REZON:</p>
<p>Rimmon receives you with his star of peace;</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">[<I>He lowers the star-point of the rod, which glows
for a moment with</I></p>
<p><I>rosy light above her head.</I>]</p>
<br>
<p>And I, his chosen minister, kneel down</p>
<p>Before your regal beauty, and implore</p>
<p>The welcome of the woman for the man.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">TSARPI: [<I>Giving him her hand, but holding off his
embrace.</I>]</p>
<p>Thus Tsarpi welcomes Rezon!  Nay, no more!</p>
<p>Till I have heard what errand brings you here</p>
<p>By night, within the garden of the man</p>
<p>Who hates you most and fears you least in all Damascus.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">REZON: [<I>Rising, and speaking angrily.</I>]</p>
<p class="ind2">Trust me, I repay his scorn</p>
<p>With double hatred,--Naaman, the man</p>
<p>Whom the King honours and the people love,</p>
<p>Who stands against the nobles and the priests,</p>
<p>Against the oracles of Rimmon's House,</p>
<p>And cries, "We'll fight to keep Damascus free!"</p>
<p>This powerful fool, this impious devotee</p>
<p>Of liberty, who loves the city more</p>
<p>Than he reveres the city's ancient god:</p>
<p>This frigid husband who sets you below</p>
<p>His dream of duty to a horde of slaves:</p>
<p>This man I hate, and I will humble him.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">TSARPI:</p>
<p>I think I hate him too.  He stands apart</p>
<p>From me, ev'n while he holds me in his arms,</p>
<p>By something that I cannot understand,</p>
<p>Nor supple to my will, nor melt with tears,</p>
<p>Nor quite dissolve with blandishments, although</p>
<p>He swears he loves his wife next to his honour!</p>
<p>Next?  That's too low!  I will be first or nothing.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">REZON:</p>
<p>With me you are the first, the absolute!</p>
<p>When you and I have triumphed you shall reign;</p>
<p>And you and I will bring this hero down.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">TSARPI:</p>
<p>But how?  For he is strong.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">REZON:</p>
<p class="ind2">By these, the eyes</p>
<p>Of Tsarpi; and by this, the rod of Rimmon.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">TSARPI:</p>
<p>Speak clearly; tell your plan.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">REZON:</p>
<p class="ind2">You know the host</p>
<p>Of the Assyrian king has broken forth</p>
<p>Again to conquer us.  Envoys have come</p>
<p>From Shalmaneser to demand surrender.</p>
<p>Our king Benhadad wavers, for he knows</p>
<p>His weakness.  All the nobles, all the rich,</p>
<p>Would purchase peace that they may grow more rich:</p>
<p>Only the people and the soldiers, led</p>
<p>By Naaman, would fight for liberty.</p>
<p>Blind fools!  To-day the envoys came to pay</p>
<p>Their worship to our god, whom they adore</p>
<p>In Nineveh as Asshur's brother-god.</p>
<p>They talked with me in secret.  Promises,</p>
<p>Great promises!  For every noble house</p>
<p>That urges peace, a noble recompense:</p>
<p>The king, submissive, kept in royal state</p>
<p>And splendour: most of all, honour and wealth</p>
<p>Shall crown the House of Rimmon, and his priest,--</p>
<p>Yea, and his priestess.  For we two will rise</p>
<p>Upon the city's fall.  The common folk</p>
<p>Shall suffer; Naaman shall sink with them</p>
<p>In wreck; but I shall rise, and you shall rise</p>
<p>Above me!  You shall climb, through incense-smoke,</p>
<p>And days of pomp, and nights of revelry,</p>
<p>Glorious rites and ecstasies of love,</p>
<p>Unto the topmost room in Rimmon's tower,</p>
<p>The secret, lofty room, the couch of bliss,</p>
<p>And the divine embraces of the god.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">TSARPI: [<I>Throwing out her arms in exultation.</I>]</p>
<p>All, all I wish!  What must I do for this?</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">REZON:</p>
<p>Turn Naaman away from thoughts of war;</p>
<p>Or purchase him with love's delights to yield</p>
<p>This point,--I care not how,--and afterwards</p>
<p>The future shall be ours.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">TSARPI:</p>
<p class="ind2">And if I fail?</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">REZON:</p>
<p>I have another shaft.  The last appeal,</p>
<p>Before the king decides, is to the oracle</p>
<p>Of Rimmon.  You shall read the signs!</p>
<p>A former priestess of his temple, you</p>
<p>Shall be the interpreter of heaven, and speak</p>
<p>A word to melt this brazen soldier's heart</p>
<p>Within his breast.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">TSARPI:</p>
<p class="ind2">But if it flame instead?</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">REZON:</p>
<p>I know the way to quench that flame.  The cup,</p>
<p>The parting cup your hand shall give to him!</p>
<p>What if the curse of Rimmon should infect</p>
<p>That wine with sacred venom, secretly</p>
<p>To work within his veins, week after week</p>
<p>Corrupting all the currents of his blood,</p>
<p>Dimming his eyes, wasting his flesh?  What then?</p>
<p>Would he prevail in war?  Would he come back</p>
<p>To glory, or to shame?  What think you?</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">TSARPI:</p>
<p class="ind4">I?</p>
<p>I do not think; I only do my part.</p>
<p>But can the gods bless this?</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">REZON:</p>
<p class="ind2">The gods can bless</p>
<p>Whatever they decree; their will makes right;</p>
<p>And this is for the glory of the house</p>
<p>Of Rimmon,--and for thee, my queen.  Come, come!</p>
<p>The night grows dark: we'll perfect our alliance.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">[<I>REZON draws her with him, embracing her, through
the shadows of the
garden.  RUAHMAH, who has been sleeping in the arbour, has been
awakened during the dialogue, and has been dimly visible in her
white
dress, behind the vines.  She parts them and comes out, pushing
back
her long, dark hair from her temples.</I>]</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">RUAHMAH:</p>
<p>What have I heard?  O God, what shame is this</p>
<p>Plotted beneath Thy pure and silent stars!</p>
<p>Was it for this that I was brought away</p>
<p>Captive from Israel's blessed hills to serve</p>
<p>A heathen mistress in a land of lies?</p>
<p>Ah, treacherous, shameful priest!  Ah, shameless wife</p>
<p>Of one too noble to suspect thy guilt!</p>
<p>The very greatness of his generous heart</p>
<p>Betrays him to their hands.  What can I do?</p>
<p>Nothing,--a slave,--hated and mocked by all</p>
<p>My fellow-slaves!  O bitter prison-life!</p>
<p>I smother in this black, betraying air</p>
<p>Of lust and luxury; I faint beneath</p>
<p>The shadow of this House of Rimmon.  God</p>
<p>Have mercy!  Lead me out to Israel.</p>
<p>To Israel!</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">[<I>Music and laughter heard within the palace.  The
doors fly open and a
flood of men and women, dancers, players, flushed with wine,
dishevelled, pour down the steps, KHAMMA and NUBTA with them.
They
crown the image with roses and dance around it.  RUAHMAH is
discovered
crouching beside the arbour.  They drag her out before the
image.</I>]</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">NUBTA:</p>
<p class="ind2">Look!  Here's the Hebrew maid,--</p>
<p>She's homesick; let us comfort her!</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">KHAMMA: [<I>They put their arms around her.</I>]</p>
<p>Yes, dancing is the cure for homesickness.</p>
<p>We'll make her dance.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">RUAHMAH: [She slips away.]</p>
<p>I pray you, let me go!</p>
<p>I cannot dance, I do not know your measures.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">KHAMMA:</p>
<p>Then sing for us,--a song of Israel!</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">RUAHMAH:</p>
<p>How can I sing the songs of Israel</p>
<p>In this strange country?  O my heart would break</p>
<p>With grief in every note of that dear music.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">A SERVANT:</p>
<p>A stubborn and unfriendly maid!  We'll whip her.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">[<I>They circle around her, striking her with
rose-branches; she sinks to
her knees, covering her face with her bare arms, which bleed.</I>]</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">NUBTA:</p>
<p>Look, look!  She kneels to Rimmon, she is tamed.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">RUAHMAH: [<I>Springing up and lifting her arms.</I>]</p>
<p>Nay, not to this dumb idol, but to Him</p>
<p>Who made Orion and the seven stars!</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">ALL:</p>
<p>She raves,--she mocks at Rimmon!  Punish her!</p>
<p>The fountain!  Wash her blasphemy away!</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">[<I>They push her toward the fountain, laughing and
shouting.  In the
open door of the palace NAAMAN appears, dressed in blue and
silver,
bareheaded and unarmed.  He comes to the top of the steps and
stands
for a moment, astonished and angry.</I>]</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">NAAMAN:</p>
<p>Silence!  What drunken rout is this?  Begone,</p>
<p>Ye barking dogs and mewing cats!  Out, all!</p>
<p>Poor child, what have they done to thee?</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">[<I>Exeunt all except RUAHMAH, who stands with her face
covered by her
hands.  NAAMAN comes to her, laying his hand on her shoulder.</I>]</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">RUAHMAH: [<I>Looking up in his face.</I>]</p>
<p class="ind2">Nothing,</p>
<p>My lord and master!  They have harmed me not.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">NAAMAN: [<I>Touching her arm.</I>]</p>
<p>Dost call this nothing?</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">RUAHMAH:</p>
<p class="ind2">Since my lord is come.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">NAAMAN:</p>
<p>I do not know thy face,--who art thou, child?</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">RUAHMAH:</p>
<p>The handmaid of thy wife.  These three years past</p>
<p>I have attended her.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">NAAMAN:</p>
<p class="ind2">Whence comest thou?</p>
<p>Thy voice is like thy mistress, but thy looks</p>
<p>Have something foreign.  Tell thy name, thy land.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">RUAHMAH:</p>
<p>Ruahmah is my name, a captive maid,</p>
<p>The daughter of a prince in Israel,--</p>
<p>Where once, in olden days, I saw my lord</p>
<p>Ride through our highlands, when Samaria</p>
<p>Was allied with Damascus to defeat</p>
<p>Asshur, our common foe.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">NAAMAN:</p>
<p class="ind2">O glorious days,</p>
<p>Crowded with life!  And thou rememberest them?</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">RUAHMAH:</p>
<p>As clear as yesterday!  Master, I saw</p>
<p>Thee riding on a snow-white horse beside</p>
<p>Our king; and all we joyful little maids</p>
<p>Strewed boughs of palm along the victors' way;</p>
<p>For you had driven out the enemy,</p>
<p>Broken; and both our lands were friends and free.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">NAAMAN: [<I>Sadly.</I>]</p>
<p>Well, they are past, those noble days!  The friends</p>
<p>That fought for freedom stand apart, rivals</p>
<p>For Asshur's favour, like two jealous dogs</p>
<p>That snarl and bite each other, while they wait</p>
<p>The master's whip, enforcing peace.  The days</p>
<p>When nations would imperil all to keep</p>
<p>Their liberties, are only memories now.</p>
<p>The common cause is lost,--and thou art brought,</p>
<p>The captive of some mercenary raid,</p>
<p>Some profitable, honourless foray,</p>
<p>To serve within my house.  Dost thou fare well?</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">RUAHMAH:</p>
<p>Master, thou seest.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">NAAMAN:</p>
<p class="ind2">Yes, I see!  My child,</p>
<p>Why do they hate thee so?</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">RUAHMAH:</p>
<p class="ind2">I do not know,</p>
<p>Unless because I will not bow to Rimmon.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">NAAMAN:</p>
<p>Thou needest not.  I fear he is a god</p>
<p>Who pities not his people, will not save.</p>
<p>My heart is sick with doubt of him.  But thou</p>
<p>Shalt hold thy faith,--I care not what it is,--</p>
<p>Worship thy god; but keep thy spirit free.</p>
<p>Here, take this chain and wear it with my seal,</p>
<p>None shall molest the maid who carries this.</p>
<p>Thou hast found favour in thy master's eyes;</p>
<p>Hast thou no other gift to ask of me?</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">RUAHMAH: [<I>Earnestly.</I>]</p>
<p>My lord, I do entreat thee not to go</p>
<p>To-morrow to the council.  Seek the King</p>
<p>And speak with him in secret; but avoid</p>
<p>The audience-hall.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">NAAMAN;</p>
<p class="ind2">Why, what is this?  Thy wits</p>
<p>Are wandering.  Why dost thou ask this thing</p>
<p>Impossible!  My honour is engaged</p>
<p>To speak for war, to lead in war against</p>
<p>The Assyrian Bull and save Damascus.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">RUAHMAH: [<I>With confused earnestness.</I>]</p>
<p>Then, lord, if thou must go, I pray thee speak,--</p>
<p>I know not how,--but so that all must hear.</p>
<p>With magic of unanswerable words</p>
<p>Persuade thy foes.  Yet watch,--beware,--</p>
<br>

descending steps: the House of Rimmon with its high tower is seen
in
the background.  The throne is at the right in front: opposite is

<p class="noindent">HAZAEL:</p>
<div class="inddiv2"><p class="noindent">Naaman can do nothing without the command of the King; and the
King
fears to order the army to march without the approval of the gods.
The High Priest is against it.  The House of Rimmon is for peace
with Asshur.</p></div>

<p class="noindent">RAKHAZ:</p>
<div class="inddiv2"><p class="noindent">Yes, and all the nobles are for peace.  We are the men whose
wisdom
lights the rudder that upholds the chariot of state.  Would we be
rich if we were not wise?  Do we not know better than the rabble

medicine will silence this fire that threatens to drown us?</p></div>

us all.</p></div>

<p class="noindent">HAZAEL:</p>
<div class="inddiv2"><p class="noindent">Not us, my lord, only the common people.  The envoys have offered
favourable terms to the priests, and the nobles, and the King.  No
palace, no temple, shall be plundered.  Only the shops, and the
markets, and the houses of the multitude shall be given up to the
Bull.  He will eat his supper from the pot of lentils, not from
our golden plate.</p></div>
<br>
<p class="noindent">RAKHAZ:</p>
<div class="inddiv2"><p class="noindent">Yes, and all who speak for peace in the council shall be enriched;
our heads shall be crowned with seats of honour in the processions
of the Assyrian king.  He needs wise counsellors to help him guide
the ship of empire onto the solid rock of prosperity.  You must be
with us, my lords Izdubhar and Saballidin, and let the stars of
your wisdom roar loudly for peace.</p></div>

shouting: RAKHAZ, HAZAEL, SHUMAKIM and others.</I></p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">FIRST CITIZEN:</p>
<p>Great news, glorious news, the Assyrians are beaten!</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">SECOND CITIZEN:</p>
<div class="inddiv2"><p class="noindent">Naaman is returning, crowned with victory.  Glory to our noble
captain!</p></div>
<br>
<p class="noindent">THIRD CITIZEN:</p>
<div class="inddiv2"><p class="noindent">No, he is killed.  I had it from one of the camp-followers who saw
him fall at the head of the battle.  They are bringing his body to
bury it with honour.  O sorrowful victory!</p></div>
<br>
<p class="noindent">RAKHAZ;</p>
<div class="inddiv2"><p class="noindent">Peace, my good fellows, you are ignorant, you have not been
rightly
informed, I will misinform you.  The accounts of Naaman's death
are
overdrawn.  He was killed, but his life has been preserved.  One
of
his wounds was mortal, but the other three were curable, and by
these the physicians have saved him.</p></div>

<div class="inddiv2"><p class="noindent">O wonderful!  Most admirable logic!  One mortal, and three

you know that you are a marvelous man?</p></div>

<p class="noindent">HAZAEL:</p>
<p>Here is Saballidin, we'll question him;</p>
<p>He was enflamed by Naaman's fiery words,</p>
<p>And rode with him to battle.  Good, my lord,</p>
<p>We hail you as a herald of the fight</p>
<p>You helped to win.  Give us authentic news</p>
<p>Of your great general!  Is he safe and well?</p>
<p>When will he come?  Or will he come at all?</p>

<br>
<p class="noindent">SABALLIDIN:</p>
<p>He comes but now, returning from the field</p>
<p>Where he hath gained a crown of deathless fame!</p>
<p>Three times he led the charge; three times he fell</p>
<p>Wounded, and the Assyrians beat us back.</p>
<p>Yet every wound was but a spur to urge</p>
<p>His valour onward.  In the last attack</p>
<p>He rode before us as the crested wave</p>
<p>That heads the flood; and lo, our enemies</p>
<p>Were broken like a dam of river-reeds,</p>
<p>Burst by the torrent, scattered, swept away!</p>
<p>But look! the Assyrian king in wavering flight</p>
<p>Is lodged like driftwood on a little hill,</p>
<p>Encircled by his guard, and stands at bay.</p>
<p>Then Naaman, followed hotly by a score</p>
<p>Of whirlwind riders, hammers through the hedge</p>
<p>Of spearmen, brandishing the golden yoke:</p>
<p>"Take back this gift," he cries; and shatters it</p>
<p>On Shalmaneser's helmet.  So the fight</p>
<p>Dissolves in universal rout: the king,</p>
<p>His chariots and his horsemen melt away;</p>
<p>Our captain stands the master of the field,</p>
<p>And saviour of Damascus!  Now he brings,</p>

<br>
<p class="noindent">RUAHMAH:</p>
<p>Peace and good health to you, Saballidin.</p>
<p>Good morrow to you all.  How fares my lord?</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">SABALLIDIN:</p>
<p>The curtains of his tent are folded still:</p>
<p>They have not moved since we returned, last night,</p>
<p>And told him what befell us in the city.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">RUAHMAH:</p>
<p>Told him!  Why did you make report to him.</p>
<p>And not to me?  Am I not captain here,</p>
<p>Intrusted by the King's command with care</p>
<p>Of Naaman's life, until he is restored?</p>
<p>'Tis mine to know the first of good or ill</p>
<p>In this adventure: mine to shield his heart</p>
<p>From every arrow of adversity.</p>
<p>What have you told him?  Speak!</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">SABALLIDIN:</p>
<p class="ind2">Lady, we feared</p>
<p>To bring our news to you.  For when the king</p>
<p>Of Israel had read our monarch's letter,</p>
<p>He rent his clothes, and cried, "Am I a god,</p>
<p>To kill and make alive, that I should heal</p>
<p>A leper?  Ye have come with false pretence,</p>
<p>Damascus seeks a quarrel with me.  Go!"</p>
<p>But when we told our lord, he closed his tent,</p>
<p>And there remains enfolded in his grief.</p>
<p>I trust he sleeps; 't were kind to let him sleep!</p>
<p>For now he doth forget his misery,</p>
<p>And all the burden of his hopeless woe</p>
<p>Is lifted from him by the gentle hand</p>
<p>Of slumber.  Oh, to those bereft of hope</p>
<p>Sleep is the only blessing left,--the last</p>
<p>Asylum of the weary, the one sign</p>
<p>Of pity from impenetrable heaven.</p>
<p>Waking is strife: sleep is the truce of God!</p>
<p>Ah, lady, wake him not.  The day will be</p>
<p>Full long for him to suffer, and for us</p>
<p>To turn our disappointed faces home</p>
<p>On the long road by which we must return.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">RUAHMAH:</p>
<p>Return!  Who gave you that command?  Not I!</p>
<p>The King made me the leader of this quest,</p>
<p>And bound you all to follow me, because</p>
<p>He knew I never would return without</p>
<p>The thing for which he sent us.  I'll go on</p>
<p>Day after day, unto the uttermost parts</p>
<p>Of earth, if need be, and beyond the gates</p>
<p>Of morning, till I find that which I seek,--</p>
<p>New life for Naaman.  Are ye ashamed</p>
<p>To have a woman lead you?  Then go back</p>
<p>And tell the King, "This huntress went too far</p>
<p>For us to follow; she pursues the trail</p>
<p>Of hope alone, refusing to forsake</p>
<p>The quarry: we grew weary of the chase;</p>
<p>And so we left her and retraced our steps,</p>
<p>Like faithless hounds, to sleep beside the fire."</p>
<p>Did Naaman forsake his soldiers thus</p>
<p>When you went forth to hunt the Assyrian Bull?</p>
<p>Your manly courage is less durable</p>
<p>Than woman's love, it seems.  Go, if you will,--</p>
<p>Who bids me now farewell?</p>

<br>
<p class="noindent">RUAHMAH:</p>
<p>Why, now you speak like men!  Brought you no word</p>
<p>Out of Samaria, except that cry</p>
<p>Of impotence and fear from Israel's king?</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">SABALLIDIN:</p>
<p>I do remember while he spoke with us</p>
<p>A rustic messenger came in, and cried</p>
<p>"Elisha saith, let Naaman come to me</p>
<p>At Dothan, he shall surely know there is</p>
<p>A God in Israel."</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">RUAHMAH:</p>
<p class="ind2">What said the King?</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">SABALLIDIN:</p>
<p>He only shouted "Go!" more wildly yet,</p>
<p>And rent his clothes again, as if he were</p>
<p>Half-maddened by a coward's fear, and thought</p>
<p>Only of how he might be rid of us.</p>
<p>What comfort could there be for him, what hope</p>
<p>For us, in the rude prophet's misty word?</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">RUAHMAH:</p>
<p>It is the very word for which I prayed!</p>
<p>My trust was not in princes; for the crown,</p>
<p>The sceptre, and the purple robe are not</p>
<p>Significant of vital power.  The man</p>
<p>Who saves his brother-men is he who lives</p>
<p>His life with Nature, takes deep hold on truth,</p>
<p>And trusts in God.  A prophet's word is more</p>
<p>Than all the kings on earth can speak.  How far</p>
<p>Is Dothan?</p>

<p>I'll hold you next to him: and if I win</p>
<p>He'll hold you next to me; and either way</p>
<p>We'll not be far apart.  Do you accept</p>
<p>My challenge?</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">SABALLIDIN:</p>
<p class="ind2">Yes!  For you enforce my heart</p>
<p>By honour to resign its great desire,</p>
<p>And love itself to offer sacrifice</p>
<p>Of all disloyal dreams on its own altar.</p>
<p>Yet love remains; therefore I pray you, think</p>
<p>How surely you must lose in our contention.</p>
<p>For I am known to Naaman: but you</p>
<p>He blindly takes for Tsarpi.  'Tis to her</p>
<p>He gives his gratitude: the praise you win</p>
<p>Endears her name.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">RUAHMAH:</p>
<p class="ind2">Her name?  Why, what is that?</p>
<p>A name is but an empty shell, a mask</p>
<p>That does not change the features of the face</p>
<p>Beneath it.  Can a name rejoice, or weep,</p>
<p>Or hope?  Can it be moved by tenderness</p>
<p>To daily services of love, or feel the warmth</p>
<p>Of dear companionship?  How many things</p>
<p>We call by names that have no meaning: kings</p>
<p>That cannot rule; and gods that are not good;</p>
<p>And wives that do not love!  It matters not</p>
<p>What syllables he utters when he calls,</p>
<p>'Tis I who come,--'tis I who minister</p>
<p>Unto my lord, and mine the living heart</p>
<p>That feels the comfort of his confidence,</p>
<p>The thrill of gladness when he speaks to me,--</p>
<p>I do not hear the name!</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">SABALLIDIN:</p>
<p class="ind2">And yet, be sure</p>
<p>There's danger in this error,--and no gain!</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">RUAHMAH:</p>
<p>I seek no gain; I only tread the path</p>
<p>Marked for me daily by the hand of love.</p>
<p>And if his blindness spared my lord one pang</p>
<p>Of sorrow in his black, forsaken hour,--</p>
<p>And if this error makes his burdened heart</p>
<p>More quiet, and his shadowed way less dark,</p>
<p>Whom do I rob?  Not her who chose to stay</p>
<p>At ease in Rimmon's House!  Surely not him!</p>
<p>Only myself?  And that enriches me.</p>
<p>Why trouble we the master?  Let it go,--</p>
<p>To-morrow he must know the truth,--and then</p>
<p>He shall dispose of me e'en as he will!</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">SABALLIDIN:</p>
<p>To-morrow?</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">RUAHMAH:</p>
<p class="ind2">Yes, for I will tarry here,</p>
<p>While you conduct him to Elisha's house</p>
<p>To find the promised healing.  I forebode</p>
<p>A sudden danger from the craven king</p>
<p>Of Israel, or else a secret ambush</p>
<p>From those who hate us in Damascus.  Go,</p>
<p>But leave me twenty men: this mountain-pass</p>
<p>Protects the road behind you.  Make my lord</p>
<p>Obey the prophet's word, whatever he commands,</p>
<p>And come again in peace.  Farewell!</p>

<p class="noindent">NAAMAN: [<I>Appearing at the entrance of his

<p>O let me ever wake to music!  For the soul</p>
<p>Returns most gently then, and finds its way</p>
<p>By the soft, winding clue of melody,</p>
<p>Out of the dusky labyrinth of sleep,</p>
<p>Into the light.  My body feels the sun</p>
<p>Though I behold naught that his rays reveal.</p>

<p class="noindent">RUAHMAH: [<I>Coming near.</I>]</p>
<p>A fairer day, dear lord, was never born</p>
<p>In Paradise!  The sapphire cup of heaven</p>
<p>Is filled with golden wine: the earth, adorned</p>
<p>With jewel-drops of dew, unveils her face</p>
<p>A joyful bride, in welcome to her king.</p>
<p>And look!  He leaps upon the Eastern hills</p>
<p>All ruddy fire, and claims her with a kiss.</p>
<p>Yonder the snowy peaks of Hermon float</p>
<p>Unmoving as a wind-dropt cloud.  The gulf</p>
<p>Of Jordan, filled with violet haze, conceals</p>
<p>The rivers winding trail with wreaths of mist.</p>
<p>Below us, marble-crowned Samaria thrones</p>
<p>Upon her emerald hill amid the Vale</p>
<p>Of Barley, while the plains to northward change</p>
<p>Their colour like the shimmering necks of doves.</p>
<p>The lark springs up, with morning on her wings,</p>
<p>To climb her singing stairway in the blue,</p>
<p>And all the fields are sprinkled with her joy!</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">NAAMAN:</p>
<p>Thy voice is magical: thy words are visions!</p>
<p>I must content myself with them, for now</p>
<p>My only hope is lost: Samaria's king</p>
<p>Rejects our monarch's message,--hast thou heard?</p>
<p>"Am I a god that I should cure a leper?"</p>
<p>He sends me home unhealed, with angry words,</p>
<p>Back to Damascus and the lingering death.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">RUAHMAH:</p>
<p>What matter where he sends?  No god is he</p>
<p>To slay or make alive.  Elisha bids</p>
<p>You come to him at Dothan, there to learn</p>
<p>There is a God in Israel.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">NAAMAN:</p>
<p class="ind2">I fear</p>
<p>That I am grown mistrustful of all gods;</p>
<p>Their secret counsels are implacable.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">RUAHMAH:</p>
<p>Fear not!  There's One who rules in righteousness</p>
<p>High over all.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">NAAMAN:</p>
<p class="ind2">What knowest thou of Him?</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">RUAHMAH:</p>
<p>Oh, I have heard,--the maid of Israel,--</p>
<p>Rememberest thou?  She often said her God</p>
<p>Was merciful and kind, and slow to wrath,</p>
<p>And plenteous in forgiveness, pitying us</p>
<p>Like as a father pitieth his children.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">NAAMAN:</p>
<p>If there were such a God, I'd worship Him</p>
<p>For ever!</p>
<br>

<p class="ind2">Then make haste to hear the word</p>
<p>His prophet promises to speak to thee!</p>
<p>Obey it, my dear lord, and thou shalt lose</p>
<p>This curse that burdens thee.  This tiny spot</p>
<p>Of white that mars the beauty of thy brow</p>
<p>Shall melt like snow; thine eyes be filled with light.</p>
<p>Thou wilt not need my leading any more,--</p>

<p>Wilt thou not lie like myrrh between my breasts</p>

<p>Or drain the fragrant chalice of thy love</p>
<p>With lips that may be fatal?  Tempt me not</p>

<p class="noindent"><I>The house of Elisha, upon a terraced hillside.  A
low stone cottage
with vine-trellises and flowers; a flight of steps, at the foot of

it.
Two soldiers come down the steps.</I></p>

<p class="noindent">SECOND SOLDIER:</p>

slammed the door in our faces.  A most unmannerly reception!</p></div>

<p class="noindent">FIRST SOLDIER:</p>

<p>What insolence is this?  Am I a man</p>
<p>To be put off with surly messengers?</p>
<p>Has not Damascus rivers more renowned</p>

<p>Abana!  Pharpar! flowing smoothly through</p>
<p>A paradise of roses?  Might I not</p>

<p>Come up, Saballidin, and guide me home!</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">SABALLIDIN:</p>
<p>Bethink thee, master, shall we lose our quest</p>
<p>Because a servant is uncouth?  The road</p>
<p>That seeks the mountain leads us through the vale.</p>
<p>The prophet's word is friendly after all;</p>
<p>For had it been some mighty task he set,</p>
<p>Thou wouldst perform it.  How much rather then</p>

<p>Ruahmah was her name,--almost forgotten!</p>
<p>So long ago,--how comes this token here?</p>
<p>What is this mystery, Saballidin?</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">SABALLIDIN:</p>
<p>Ruahmah is her name who brought you hither.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">NAAMAN:</p>
<p>Where then is Tsarpi?</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">SABALLIDIN:</p>
<p class="ind2">In Damascus.</p>
<p>She left you when the curse of Rimmon fell,--</p>
<p>Took refuge in his House,--and there she waits</p>
<p>Her lord's return,--Rezon's return.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">NAAMAN:</p>
<p class="ind2">'Tis false!</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">SABALLIDIN:</p>
<p>The falsehood is in her.  She hath been friend</p>
<p>With Rezon in his priestly plot to win</p>
<p>Assyria's favour,--friend to his design</p>
<p>To sell his country to enrich his temple,--</p>
<p>And friend to him in more,--I will not name it.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">NAAMAN:</p>
<p>Nor will I credit it.  Impossible!</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">SABALLIDIN:</p>
<p>Did she not plead with you against the war,</p>
<p>Counsel surrender, seek to break your will?</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">NAAMAN:</p>
<p>She did not love my work, a soldier's task.</p>
<p>She never seemed to be at one with me</p>
<p>Until I was a leper.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">SABALLIDIN:</p>
<p class="ind2">From whose hand</p>
<p>Did you receive the sacred cup?</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">NAAMAN:</p>
<p class="ind2">From hers.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">SABALLIDIN:</p>
<p>And from that hour the curse began to work.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">NAAMAN:</p>
<p>But did she not have pity when she saw</p>
<p>Me smitten?  Did she not beseech the King</p>
<p>For letters and a guard to make this journey?</p>
<p>Has she not been the fountain of my hope,</p>
<p>My comforter and my most faithful guide</p>
<p>In this adventure of the dark?  All this</p>
<p>Is proof of perfect love that would have shared</p>
<p>A leper's doom rather than give me up.</p>
<p>Can I doubt her who dared to love like this?</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">SABALLIDIN:</p>
<p>O master, doubt her not,--but know her name;</p>
<p>Ruahmah!  It was she alone who wrought</p>
<p>This wondrous work of love.  She won the King</p>
<p>By the strong pleading of resistless hope</p>
<p>To furnish forth this company.  She led</p>
<p>Our march, kept us in heart, fought off despair,</p>
<p>Offered herself to you as to her god,</p>
<p>Watched over you as if you were her child,</p>
<p>Prepared your food, your cup, with her own hands,</p>
<p>Sang you asleep at night, awake at dawn,--</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">NAAMAN: [<I>Interrupting.</I>]</p>
<p>Enough!  I do remember every hour</p>
<p>Of that sweet comradeship!  And now her voice</p>
<p>Wakens the echoes in my lonely breast;</p>
<p>The perfume of her presence fills my sense</p>
<p>With longing.  All my soul cries out in vain</p>
<p>For her embracing, satisfying love,</p>
<p>her eyes and called her my Ruahmah!</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">[<I>To his soldiers.</I>]</p>
<br>
<p>Away! away!  I burn to take the road</p>
<p>That leads me back to Rimmon's House,--</p>
<p>But not to bow,--by God, never to bow!</p>

<p class="noindent">TIME: <I>Three days later</I></p>
<br>
<H3 ALIGN="center">SCENE II</H3>
<br>
<p class="noindent"><I>Inner court of the House of Rimmon; a temple with
huge pillars at each
side.  In the right foreground the seat of the King; at the left,
of
equal height, the seat of the High Priest.  In the background a
broad
flight of steps, rising to a curtain of cloudy gray, embroidered
with
two gigantic hands holding thunderbolts.  The temple is in half
darkness at first.  Enter KHAMMA and NUBTA, robed as Kharimati, or
religious dancers, in gowns of black gauze with yellow embroideries
and
mantles.</I></p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">KHAMMA:</p>
<div class="inddiv2"><p class="noindent">All is ready for the rites of worship; our lady will play a great
part
in them.  She has put on her Tyrian robes, and all her ornaments.</p></div>
<br>
<p class="noindent">NUBTA:</p>
<div class="inddiv2"><p class="noindent">That is a sure sign of a religious purpose.  She is most devout,
our
lady Tsarpi!</p></div>
<br>
<p class="noindent">KHAMMA:</p>
<div class="inddiv2"><p class="noindent">A favourite of Rimmon, too!  The High Priest has assured her of
it.
He is a great man,--next to the King, now that Naaman is gone.</p></div>
<br>
<p class="noindent">NUBTA:</p>
<p>But if Naaman should come back, healed of the leprosy?</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">KHAMMA:</p>
<div class="inddiv2"><p class="noindent">How can he come back?  The Hebrew slave that went away with him,
when
they caught her, said that he was dead.  The High Priest has shut
her
up in the prison of the temple, accusing her of her master's
death.</p></div>
<br>
<p class="noindent">NUBTA:</p>
<div class="inddiv2"><p class="noindent">Yet I think he does not believe it, for I heard him telling our
mistress what to do if Naaman should return.</p></div>
<br>
<p class="noindent">KHAMMA:</p>
<p>What, then?</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">NUBTA:</p>
<div class="inddiv2"><p class="noindent">She will claim him as her husband.  Was she not wedded to him
before
the god?  That is a sacred bond.  Only the High Priest can loose
it.
She will keep her hold on Naaman for the sake of the House of
Rimmon.
A wife knows her husband's secrets, she can tell----</p></div>
<br>
<p class="noindent">[<I>Enter SHUMAKIM, with his flagon, walking
unsteadily.</I>]</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">KHAMMA:</p>
<p>Hush! here comes the fool Shumakim.  He is never sober.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">SHUMAKIM: [<I>Laughing.</I>]</p>
<div class="inddiv2"><p class="noindent">Are there two of you?  I see two, but that is no proof.  I think
there
is only one, but beautiful enough for two.  What were you talking
to
yourself about, fairest one!</p></div>
<br>
<p class="noindent">KHAMMA:</p>
<div class="inddiv2"><p class="noindent">About the lady Tsarpi, fool, and what she would do if her husband
returned.</p></div>
<br>
<p class="noindent">SHUMAKIM:</p>
<div class="inddiv2"><p class="noindent">Fie! fie!  That is no talk for an innocent fool to hear.  Has she
a
husband?</p></div>
<br>
<p class="noindent">NUBTA:</p>
<p>You know very well that she is the wife of Lord Naaman.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">SHUMAKIM:</p>
<div class="inddiv2"><p class="noindent">I remember that she used to wear his name and his jewels.  But I
thought he had exchanged her,--for a leprosy.</p></div>
<br>
<p class="noindent">KHAMMA:</p>
<div class="inddiv2"><p class="noindent">You must have heard that he went away to Samaria to look for
healing.
Some say that he died on the journey; but others say he has been
cured, and is on his way home to his wife.</p></div>
<br>
<p class="noindent">SHUMAKIM:</p>
<div class="inddiv2"><p class="noindent">It may be, for this is a mad world, and men never know when they
are
well off,--except us fools.  But he must come soon if he would
find
his wife as he parted from her,--or the city where he left it.
The
Assyrians have returned with a greater army, and this time they
will
make an end of us.  There is no Naaman how, and the Bull will
devour
Damascus like a bunch of leeks, flowers and all,--flowers and all,
my double-budded fair one!  Are you not afraid?</p></div>
<br>
<p class="noindent">NUBTA:</p>
<p>We belong to the House of Rimmon.  He will protect us.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">SHUMAKIM:</p>
<div class="inddiv2"><p class="noindent">What?  The mighty one who hides behind the curtain there, and
tells
his secrets to Rezon?  No doubt he will take care of you, and of
himself.  Whatever game is played, the gods never lose.  But for
the
protection, of the common people and the rest of us fools, I would
rather have Naaman at the head of an army than all the sacred
images
between here and Babylon.</p></div>
<br>
<p class="noindent">KHAMMA:</p>
<p>You are a wicked old man.  You mock the god.  He will punish you.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">SHUMAKIM: [<I>Bitterly.</I>]</p>
<div class="inddiv2"><p class="noindent">How can he punish me?  Has he not already made me a fool?  Hark,
here
comes my brother the High Priest, and my brother the King.  Rimmon
made us all; but nobody knows who made Rimmon, except the High
Priest; and he will never tell.</p></div>
<br>
<p class="noindent">[<I>Gongs and cymbals sound.  Enter REZON with priests,
and the King with
courtiers.  They take their seats.  A throng of Khali and
Kharimati
come in, TSARPI presiding; a sacred dance is performed with
torches,
burning incense, and chanting, in which TSARPI leads.</I>]</p>
<br>
<p>CHANT.</p>
<br>
<p><I>Hail, mighty Rimmon, ruler of the whirl-storm,</I></p>
<p><I>Hail, shaker of mountains, breaker-down of forests,</I></p>
<p><I>Hail, thou who roarest terribly in the darkness,</I></p>
<p><I>Hail, thou whose arrows flame across the heavens!</I></p>
<p><I>Hail, great destroyer, lord of flood and tempest,</I></p>
<p><I>In thine anger almighty, in thy wrath eternal,</I></p>
<p><I>Thou who delightest in ruin, maker of desolations,</I></p>
<p><I>Immeru, Addu, Barku, Rimmon!</I></p>
<p><I>See we tremble before thee, low we bow at thine altar,</I></p>
<p><I>Have mercy upon us, be favourable unto us,</I></p>
<p><I>Save us from our enemy, accept our sacrifice,</I></p>
<p><I>Barku, Immeru, Addu, Rimmon!</I></p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">[<I>Silence follows, all bowing down.</I>]</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">REZON:</p>
<p>O King, last night the counsel from above</p>
<p>Was given in answer to our divination.</p>
<p>Ambassadors must go forthwith to crave</p>
<p>Assyria's pardon, and a second offer</p>
<p>Of the same terms of peace we did reject</p>
<p>Not long ago.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">BENHADAD:</p>
<p class="ind2">Dishonour!  Yet I see</p>
<p>No other way!  Assyria will refuse,</p>
<p>Or make still harder terms.  Disaster, shame</p>
<p>For this gray head, and ruin for Damascus!</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">REZON:</p>
<p>Yet may we trust Rimmon will favour us,</p>
<p>If we adhere devoutly to his worship.</p>
<p>He will incline his brother-god, the Bull,</p>
<p>To spare us, if we supplicate him now</p>
<p>With costly gifts.  Therefore I have prepared</p>
<p>A sacrifice: Rimmon shall be well pleased</p>
<p>With the red blood that bathes his knees to-night!</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">BENHADAD:</p>
<p>My mind is dark with doubt,--I do forebode</p>
<p>Some horror!  Let me go,--I am an old man,--</p>
<p>If Naaman my captain were alive!</p>
<p>But he is dead,--the glory is departed!</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">[<I>He rises, trembling, to leave the throne.  Trumpet
sounds,--NAAMAN'S
call;--enter NAAMAN, followed by soldiers; he kneels at the foot of
the throne.</I>]</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">BENHADAD: [<I>Half-whispering.</I>]</p>
<p>Art thou a ghost escaped from Allatu?</p>
<p>How didst thou pass the seven doors of death?</p>
<p>O noble ghost I am afraid of thee,</p>
<p>And yet I love thee,--let me hear thy voice!</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">NAAMAN:</p>
<p>No ghost, my King, but one who lives to serve</p>
<p>Thee and Damascus with his heart and sword</p>
<p>As in the former days.  The only God</p>
<p>Has healed my leprosy: my life is clean</p>
<p>To offer to my country and my King.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">BENHADAD: [<I>Starting toward him.</I>]</p>
<p>O welcome to thy King!  Thrice welcome!</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">REZON; [<I>Leaving his seat and coming toward
NAAMAN.</I>]</p>
<p class="ind2">Stay!</p>
<p>The leper must appear before the priest,</p>
<p>The only one who can pronounce him clean.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">[<I>NAAMAN turns; they stand looking each other in the
face.</I>]</p>
<br>
<p>Yea,--thou art cleansed: Rimmon hath pardoned
thee,--</p>
<p>In answer to the daily prayers of her</p>
<p>Whom he restores to thine embrace,--thy wife.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">[<I>TSARPI comes slowly toward NAAMAN.</I>]</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">NAAMAN:</p>
<p>From him who rules this House will I receive</p>
<p>Nothing!  I seek no pardon from his priest,</p>
<p>No wife of mine among his votaries!</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">TSARPI: [<I>Holding out her hands.</I>]</p>
<p>Am I not yours?  Will you renounce our vows?</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">NAAMAN:</p>
<p>The vows were empty,--never made you mine</p>
<p>In aught but name.  A wife is one who shares</p>
<p>Her husband's thought, incorporates his heart</p>
<p>With hers by love, and crowns him with her trust.</p>
<p>She is God's remedy for loneliness,</p>
<p>And God's reward for all the toil of life.</p>
<p>This you have never been to me,--and so</p>
<p>I give you back again to Rimmon's House</p>
<p>Where you belong.  Claim what you will of mine,--</p>
<p>Not me!  I do renounce you,--or release you,--</p>
<p>According to the law.  If you demand</p>
<p>A further cause than what I have declared,</p>
<p>I will unfold it fully to the King.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">REZON: [<I>Interposing hurriedly.</I>]</p>
<p>No need of that!  This duteous lady yields</p>
<p>To your caprice as she has ever done;</p>
<p>She stands a monument of loyalty</p>
<p>And woman's meekness.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">NAAMAN:</p>
<p class="ind2">Let her stand for that!</p>
<p>Adorn your temple with her piety!</p>
<p>But you in turn restore to me the treasure</p>
<p>You stole at midnight from my tent.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">REZON:</p>
<p>What treasure?  I have stolen none from you.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">NAAMAN:</p>
<p>The very jewel of my soul,--Ruahmah!</p>
<p>My King, the captive maid of Israel,</p>
<p>To whom thou didst commit my broken life</p>
<p>With letters to Samaria,--my light,</p>
<p>My guide, my saviour in this pilgrimage,--</p>
<p>Dost thou remember?</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">BENHADAD:</p>
<p class="ind2">I recall the maid,--</p>
<p>But dimly,--for my mind is old and weary.</p>
<p>She was a fearless maid, I trusted her</p>
<p>And gave thee to her charge.  Where is she now?</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">NAAMAN:</p>
<p>This robber fell upon my camp by night,--</p>
<p>While I was with Elisha at the Jordan,--</p>
<p>Slaughtered my soldiers, carried off the maid,</p>
<p>And holds her somewhere in imprisonment.</p>
<p>O give this jewel back to me, my King,</p>
<p>And I will serve thee with a grateful heart</p>
<p>For ever.  I will fight for thee, and lead</p>
<p>Thine armies on to glorious victory</p>
<p>Over all foes!  Thou shalt no longer fear</p>
<p>The host of Asshur, for thy throne shall stand</p>
<p>Encompassed with a wall of dauntless hearts,</p>
<p>And founded on a mighty people's love,</p>
<p>And guarded by the God of righteousness.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">BENHADAD:</p>
<p>I feel the flame of courage at thy breath</p>
<p>Leap up among the ashes of despair.</p>
<p>Thou hast returned to save us!  Thou shalt have</p>
<p>The maid; and thou shalt lead my host again!</p>
<p>Priest, I command you give her back to him.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">REZON:</p>
<p>O master, I obey thy word as thou</p>
<p>Hast ever been obedient to the voice</p>
<p>Of Rimmon.  Let thy fiery captain wait</p>
<p>Until the sacrifice has been performed,</p>
<p>And he shall have the jewel that he claims.</p>
<p>Must we not first placate the city's god</p>
<p>With due allegiance, keep the ancient faith,</p>
<p>And pay our homage to the Lord of Wrath?</p>

<p>But still a King!  O Naaman, be patient!</p>
<p>Priest, let the sacrifice be offered.</p>
<br>
<p class="noindent">[<I>The High Priest lifts his rod.  Gongs and cymbals
sound.  The curtain
is rolled back, disclosing the image of Rimmon; a gigantic and
hideous
idol, with a cruel human face, four horns, the mane of a lion, and
huge
paws stretched in front of him enclosing a low altar of black
stone.
RUAHMAH stands on the altar, chained, her arms are bare and folded
on
her breast.  The people prostrate themselves in silence, with signs

astonishment and horror.</I>]</p>

crying "Sacrilege!
Kill him!"  But the soldiers stand on the steps and beat them back.

confusion.  The King rises and speaks with a loud voice, silence
follows.</I>]</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
